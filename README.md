## About Me ##
I am from Sarasota, Florida where the majority of my family still lives, but I primarily live in Indianapolis, Indiana. After graduating from Indiana University (IU) with a Bachelors in Management, I began my career at IBM where I worked in Technology Sales. I am excited to learn more about coding and development through this class to help round out some of my knowledge.
## Past Coding Experience ##
During some of my internships, I coded ChatBots through a closed system at IBM. My experience was guided with a close hand the entire time, and I have not done much since then. Additionally, when I was very young I did code my MySpace pages, but I do not remember the majority of what was done there.
## Immediate Career Goals ##
1. Graduate with Masters Degree in December 2024
2. Complete my PMP (Project Management Professional) Certification in March 2025
3. Complete career switch to Consulting, working towards Associate Director rank by May 2025
